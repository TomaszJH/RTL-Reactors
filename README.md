# Expanded-Reactors
Expanded Reactors mod for Minecraft aiming in introducing realistic reactors into the game that generate heat which can be converted into steam and then into electricity.

**WARNING! THIS MOD IS A HEAVY WIP, AND THUS SHOULD NOT BE USED UNLESS YOU ARE WORKING ON IT!**

I do not take any responsibility for corrupted worlds / destroyed bases for using an unfinished mod.

##Why am I making another reactor mod?
Answer is simple, all other mods are either not implementing realistic reactors, or are made for an older version and will not update to newer versions.


##To do List:
* Implement the RBMK reactor, and all subsystems that match the real-world counterpart (main goal)
* Implement a nuclear fuel processing system (all stages to match real-world actions)
* Implement the VVER/PWR reactors
* Implement the BWR reactor
* Implement a working manual
* Implement more tools
* Add ores and resources

Any help with the mod would be appreciated since this is the first time I am making one and I am doing it in spare time.
